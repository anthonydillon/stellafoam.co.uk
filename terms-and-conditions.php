The Customer should ensure that they have the up to date price for the Goods before making an Order.</p>
                <p>3.2 To the extent that the Goods are to be manufactured in accordance with a Specification supplied by the Customer, the Customer shall indemnify Stellafoam against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties and legal and other professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by Stellafoam in connection with any claim made against Stellafoam for actual or alleged infringement of a third party's intellectual property rights arising out of or in connection with Stellafoam's use of the Specification. This clause 3.2 shall survive termination of the Contract.</p>
                <p>3.3 Stellafoam reserves the right to amend the specification of the Goods if required by any applicable statutory or regulatory requirements.</p>
                <p><h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">4. Delivery</h3></p>
                <p>4.1 Stellafoam shall ensure that each delivery of the Goods is accompanied by a delivery note which shows the date of the Order, all relevant Customer and Stellafoam reference numbers, the type and quantity of the Goods (including the code numberof the Goods, where applicable), special storage instructions (if any) and, if the Order is being delivered by instalments, the outstanding balance of Goods remaining to be delivered.</p>
                <p>4.2 Stellafoam shall deliver the Goods to the location set out in the Order or such other location as the parties may agree (Delivery Location) at any time after Stellafoam notifies the Customer that the Goods are ready.</p>
                <p>4.3 Delivery of the Goods shall be completed on the Goods' arrival at the Delivery Location.</p>
                <p>4.4 Any dates quoted for delivery are approximate only, and the time of delivery is not of the essence. Stellafoam shall not be liable for any delay in delivery of the Goods that is caused by a Force Majeure Event or the Customer's failure to provide Stellafoam with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of the Goods or any other default of the Customer.</p>
                <p>4.5 The Customer shall provide, at its own expense, the labour necessary for unloading the Goods, such labour to be available during normal working hours on the day notified by Stellafoam for delivery. Stellafoam shall not be liable for any damage that occurs in the course of unloading. The Customer shall unload the Goods with reasonable speed.

                <p>4.6 Where Stellafoam in its absolute discretion determines that mechanical handling or cranage is appropriate for delivery, such facilities must be provided by the Customer on site to facilitate the unloading of the Goods from the delivery vehicle.</p>
                <p>4.7 The Customer warrants that the delivery address will be capable of receiving delivery by large lorry. Stellafoam reserves the right to refuse to deliver Goods to premises considered at the discretion of Stellafoam to be unsuitable and to charge an appropriate fee in respect of any failed delivery.</p>
                <p>4.8 If Stellafoam fails to deliver the Goods, its liability shall be limited to the costs and expenses incurred by the Customer in obtaining replacement goods of similar description and quality in the cheapest market available, less the price of the Goods. Stellafoam shall have no liability for any failure to deliver the Goods to the extent that such failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event or the Customer's failure to provide Stellafoam with adequate delivery instructions or any other instructions that are relevant to the supply of the Goods.</p>
                <p>4.9 If the Customer fails to accept delivery of the Goods within two Business Days of Stellafoam notifying the Customer that the Goods are ready, then, except where such failure or delay is caused by a Force Majeure Event or Stellafoam's failure to comply with its obligations under the Contract:</p>
                <p>(a) delivery of the Goods shall be deemed to have been completed at 9:00am on the second Business Day after the day on which Stellafoam notified the Customer that the Goods were ready; and</p>
                <p>(b) Stellafoam shall store the Goods until delivery takes place, and charge the Customer for all related costs and expenses (including insurance).</p>

                <p>4.11 If the Customer wishes to claim that there is any shortage on the delivery of any Goods or that any of the Goods are delivered damaged, the Customer shall give notice in writing to Stellafoam within 48 hours of delivery, failing which the Goods shall be deemed to have been delivered undamaged and in accordance with the delivery documents.</p>
                <p>(a) If short delivery does take place, the Customer shall not reject the Goods but shall accept the Goods delivered as part performance of the Contract</p>
                <p>(b) If short delivery or damaged Goods are complained of, Stellafoam shall be under no liability in respect thereof unless a reasonable opportunity is provided to Stellafoam before any use thereof is made by the Customer</p>
                <p>(c)Stellafoam’s liability for short delivery or damaged Goods shall be strictly limited to the provision of any Goods not delivered or the replacement or, at Stellafoam’s option, repair of any damaged Goods.</p>
                <p>4.12 Stellafoam reserves the right to make delivery by instalments and to tender a separate invoice in respect of each instalment.</p>

Product descriptions / illustrations contained in Stellafoam’s sales literature are for assistance purposes only and do not constitute representations in respect of the Goods. It is the Customer’s responsibility to ensure that the Goods meet the Customer’s requirements, including as regards matching products.</p>

                <p>(b) the defect arises because the Customer failed to follow Stellafoam's oral or written instructions as to the storage, commissioning, installation, use and maintenance of the Goods or (if there are none) good trade practice regarding the same;</p>
                <p>(c) the defect arises as a result of Stellafoam following any drawing, design or Specification supplied by the Customer;</p>
                <p>(d) the Customer alters or repairs such Goods without the written consent of Stellafoam;</p>
                <p>(e) the defect arises as a result of fair wear and tear, wilful damage, negligence, or abnormal storage or working conditions; or</p>
                <p>(f) the Goods differ from their description or any applicable Specification as a result of changes made to ensure they comply with applicable statutory or regulatory requirements.</p>

                <p>(a) Stellafoam receives payment in full (in cash or cleared funds) for the Goods and any other goods or services that Stellafoam has supplied to the Customer; and</p>
                <p>(b) the Customer resells the Goods, in which case title to the Goods shall pass to the Customer at the time specified in clause 6.4.</p>
                <p>6.3 Until title to the Goods has passed to the Customer, the Customer shall:</p>

                <p>(d) maintain the Goods in satisfactory condition and keep them insured against all risks for their full price from the date of delivery;</p>

                <p>6.4 Subject to clause 6.5, the Customer may resell or use the Goods in the ordinary course of its business (but not otherwise) before Stellafoam receives payment for the Goods. However, if the Customer resells the Goods before that time: it does so as principal and not as Stellafoam’s agent; and title to the Goods shall pass from Stellafoam to the Customer immediately before the time at which resale by the Customer occurs.6.5 If before title to the Goods passes to the Customer the Customer becomes subject to any of the events listed in clause 8.2, or Stellafoam reasonably believes that any such event is about to happen and notifies the Customer accordingly, then, without limiting any other right or remedy Stellafoam may have:</p>
                <p>(a) the Customer’s right to resell the Goods or use them in the ordinary course of its business ceases immediately; and</p>
                <p>(b) Stellafoam may at any time require the Customer to deliver up the Goods and, if the Customer fails to do so promptly, enter any premises of the Customer or of any third party where the Goods are stored in order to recover them.</p>
                <p><h3 style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">7. Price and Payment</h3></p>
                <p>7.1 The price of the Goods shall be the price set out in Stellafoam’s written acceptance of the Order or as otherwise agreed in writing by Stellafoam.</p>
                <p>7.2 Stellafoam may, by giving notice to the Customer at any time before delivery, increase the price of the Goods to reflect any increase in the cost of the Goods that is due to:</p>
                <p>(a) any factor beyond Stellafoam's control (including foreign exchange fluctuations, shipping and freight rate increases and increases in taxes and duties);</p>
                <p>(b) any request by the Customer to change the delivery date(s), quantities or types of Goods ordered, or the Specification; or</p>
                <p>(c) any delay caused by any instructions of the Customer or failure of the Customer to give Stellafoam adequate or accurate information or instructions.</p>
                <p>7.3 Unless otherwise stated, the price of the Goods is inclusive of the costs and charges of packaging and insurance. Unless otherwise stated and subject to variation by Stellafoam, for orders of over £150 plus VAT, the order price includes the cost of delivery by Stellafoam to the Customer’s premises as specified in the Order (which must comply with clause 4) in one delivery, on week days during normal working hours. Orders of under £150 plus VAT are subject to a delivery charge of £35 plus</p>
                <p>VAT. Re-deliveries due to the fault of the Customer are, at Stellafoam’s discretion, subject to a re-delivery charge of £35 plus VAT.</p>
                <p>7.4 The price of the Goods is exclusive of amounts in respect of value added tax (VAT). The Customer shall, on receipt of a valid VAT invoice from Stellafoam, pay to Stellafoam such additional amounts in respect of VAT as are chargeable on the supply of the Goods.</p>
                <p>7.5 Stellafoam may invoice the Customer for the Goods at any time on or after Stellafoam accepts the Order in respect of bespoke / made to measure products and at any time on or after the completion of delivery in respect of any other products.</p>
                <p>Stellafoam may require the Customer to pay a deposit in cleared funds prior to shipping.</p>
                <p>7.6 Customers with Stellafoam accounts shall pay the invoice in full and in cleared funds within 30 days of the end of the month of purchase or within such other period as may be agreed in writing and signed by Stellafoam. Payment shall be made to the bank account nominated in writing by Stellafoam. Time of payment is of the essence. Customers without Stellafoam accounts shall pay cash on delivery.</p>
                <p>7.7 If the Customer fails to make any payment due to Stellafoam under the Contract by the due date for payment (due date), then the Customer shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate from time to time in force under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1988. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.</p>
                <p>7.8 The Customer shall pay all amounts due under the Contract in full without any deduction or withholding except as required by law and the Customer shall not be entitled to assert any credit, set-off or counterclaim against Stellafoam in order to justify withholding payment of any such amount in whole or in part. Stellafoam may at any time, without limiting any other rights or remedies it may have, set off any amount owing to it by the Customer against any amount payable by Stellafoam to the Customer.</p>
